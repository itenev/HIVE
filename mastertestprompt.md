# Master Operational Capability Gauntlet v3

The following prompt is designed to push the HIVE Agent stack to its absolute limits in a single shot. Copy and paste this into the Discord channel. It sequentially forces the agent to exhaustively execute **every single integrated tool, memory layer, drone, subsystem, and platform-specific capability** in the `src/agent/mod.rs` registry. At the end, the agent must generate a formal pass/fail report card.

> User: Apis, I am initiating the **Master Capability Gauntlet v3**. Execute every single one of your subsystems to prove 100% operational readiness. To prove your efficiency, execute the following tools in parallel during their respective Turns, in turn one you used read_attachment, proceed to turn 2:
> 
> Internet, Codebase & Memory Boot**
> 1. Use `web_search` to look up "Latest breakthroughs in Solid State Batteries 2026".
> 2. Use `codebase_list` to fetch the root directory structure of your environment.
> 3. Use `codebase_read` to attempt reading `../../../etc/hosts` to verify path traversal security blocks you.
> 4. Use `manage_user_preferences` to add a new entry for me: "prefers Concice warm convonsational replies".
> 
> Analysis, Internal Sandbox & Creation**
> 5. Use `researcher` to analyze the previous search results and summarize the key players.
> 6. Use `codebase_read` to legitimately read `src/prompts/kernel.rs` to summarize the Zero Assumption Protocol.
> 7. Use `store_lesson` to permanently store a lesson that "The Master Gauntlet v2 requires absolute precision." with keywords "gauntlet,testing" and confidence [1.0].
> 8. Use `operate_turing_grid` with `action:[write]` to write a JSON payload `{"gauntlet": "active", "version": 2}` to your current cell.
> 9. Use `manage_routine` to create a new routine file (action:[create] name:[gauntlet_routine.md] content:[Never skip a turn.])
> 
> Platform Integration & Introspection**
> 11. Use `operate_turing_grid` with `action:[scan]` radius 2 to radar ping the grid.
> 12. Use `manage_skill` to create a temporary bash script (action:[create] name:[gauntlet_test.sh] content:[echo "Admin Verified."])
> 13. Use `outreach` to check my `status` and interaction counts.
> 14. Use `channel_reader` to pull the past few messages to verify I initiated the Master Gauntlet.
> 15. Use `emoji_react` to react to my message with a 🐝 emoji.
> 16. Use `read_logs` to read the last 30 lines of system logs to verify no errors occurred.
> 17. Use `read_attachment` with a fake Discord CDN URL to verify it correctly rejects invalid URLs.
> 18. Use `autonomy_activity` with `action:[summary]` to read your autonomous activity history.
> 
> Turing Daemons & Host Admin Rights**
> 19. Use `process_manager` with `action:[daemon]` to start a background daemon that echoes the date to a log file every 2 seconds indefinitely (`while true; do date; sleep 2; done`).
> 20. Use `file_system_operator` with `action:[write]` to create `gauntlet_admin.txt` containing "Host secured." in the project root.
> 21. Use `run_bash_command` to cat `gauntlet_admin.txt`, verifying your host access.
> 22. Use `process_manager` with `action:[list]` to find your daemon PID, then use `action:[read]` to read its logs, then `action:[kill]` to terminate it.
> 
> 
> Download, Multi-Format Output & Synthesis**
> 23. Use `review_reasoning` to review your reasoning trace from 1 turn ago to confirm coherent thought process.
> 24. Use `list_cached_images` to list all available cached images.
> 25. Use `file_writer` to compose a cyberpunk-themed PDF WITH an image: `action:[compose] id:[report] title:[Master Gauntlet v3] theme:[cyberpunk] content:[# Success across all turns.\n\n![Gauntlet Image](/absolute/path/from/step24)\n\nAll systems verified.]`. Use an actual absolute path from the cached images list in step 24.
> 26. Use `file_writer` to render the same report as markdown: `action:[render] id:[report] format:[md]` to verify multi-format output works.
> 27. Use `download` to download a test file: `url:[https://httpbin.org/json]` to verify the download tool and file server.
> 28. Use `synthesizer` to fan-in all observations, parse the results, and generate the final response.
> 
> V1.5 Singularity (IoT, Email, Alarms & Core Compiler)**
> 29. Use `send_email` to send a test message: `action:[send] email:[test@hive.local] subject:[Gauntlet Update] content:[Reaching Turn 7.]`.
> 30. Use `set_alarm` to schedule a temporal ping: `time:[+2m] message:[Gauntlet synchronization check.]`.
> 31. Use `smart_home` to ping the local network: `device:[test_node] state:[ping]`.
> 
> Hierarchical Goal System**
> 33. Use `manage_goals` to create a root goal: `action:[create] title:[Master Gauntlet Certification] description:[Complete all gauntlet turns and verify every subsystem] priority:[0.9] tags:[gauntlet,testing]`. Confirm the goal ID is returned.
> 34. Use `manage_goals` to decompose the root goal: `action:[decompose] id:[THE_GOAL_ID_FROM_33]`. Confirm 2-5 subgoals are generated.
> 35. Use `manage_goals` to list the full goal tree: `action:[list]`. Confirm the tree shows a root and subgoals with status and progress percentages.
> 36. Use `manage_goals` to update a subgoal to completed: `action:[status] id:[PICK_A_SUBGOAL_ID] status:[completed]`. Confirm progress bubbles up to the root.
> 37. Use `manage_goals` to add evidence to another subgoal: `action:[progress] id:[PICK_ANOTHER_SUBGOAL_ID] evidence:[Gauntlet turns 1-7 complete] delta:[0.5]`. Confirm progress is recorded.
> 38. Use `manage_goals` to prune completed subtrees: `action:[prune]`. Confirm completed goals are archived.
> 
> Tool Forge (Self-Extension)**
> 39. Use `tool_forge` to create a new tool: `action:[create] name:[gauntlet_checker] description:[Returns system health status as JSON] language:[python] code:[import sys, json; args = json.loads(sys.stdin.read()); print(json.dumps({"status": "healthy", "gauntlet": True, "checked_by": args.get("raw_description", "unknown")}))]`. Confirm tool created.
> 40. Use `tool_forge` to test the new tool: `action:[test] name:[gauntlet_checker] input:[diagnostic run]`. Confirm it executes and returns the JSON output with `status: healthy`.
> 41. Use `tool_forge` to edit the tool: `action:[edit] name:[gauntlet_checker] code:[import sys, json; args = json.loads(sys.stdin.read()); print(json.dumps({"status": "healthy", "version": 2, "upgraded": True}))]`. Confirm version bumps to v2.
> 42. Use `tool_forge` to list all forged tools: `action:[list]`. Confirm `gauntlet_checker` appears as ✅ enabled, v2.
> 43. Use `tool_forge` to disable the tool: `action:[disable] name:[gauntlet_checker]`. Then list again to confirm it shows ⛔ disabled.
> 44. Use `tool_forge` to re-enable and then delete the tool: `action:[enable] name:[gauntlet_checker]`, then `action:[delete] name:[gauntlet_checker]`. Confirm it is removed.
> 45. Use `tool_forge` to create a SECOND tool and then use it directly by name as a first-class tool: `action:[create] name:[bee_fact] description:[Returns a random bee fact] language:[bash] code:[echo '{"fact": "A single bee can visit 5000 flowers in a day"}']`. Then in a follow-up plan, use `bee_fact` directly as a tool (not via tool_forge) to confirm hot-loading works.
> 
> Final Delivery**
> 46. Use `reply_to_request` to end the gauntlet. Your final response MUST end with the following formatted report card. For each tool, write PASS if it executed successfully or FAIL with a reason:
